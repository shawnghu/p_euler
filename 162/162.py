# i think this one is stupid?
# it's just a combinatorics problem
# it might even be doable without a computer...

# approach: 
# condition on there being a 0, 1, and A, which can be permuted in 6 ways and placed in 16C3 ways
# the remaining 13 digits can be anything, so we get 16^13

# one problem is that we can't have a leading zero

# i am an idiot, two wrongs make a right more or less and the leading zero just makes a shorter number
# as long as there is a 0 somewhere else?
