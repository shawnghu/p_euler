Solutions to some Project Euler problems.

You're not supposed to share these, but user nayuki kind of let the cat out of the bag, as did many others, as evidenced partially by the fact that LLM coding assistants can autocomplete some of the problems.

Hopefully the name of the repo obscures things slightly, so that only those who are trying to ruin the problem for themselves do so.


If you have a serious problem with my having posted these, please contact me.
